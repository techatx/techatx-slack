TechATX Code of Conduct
========================

# What we're here for

The TechATX community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from all over the world and work together to make our community better, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with people inside and outside the community. TechATX is founded on the idea that a strong community benefits everyone. To that end, please consider as a guideline that you should always try to benefit the community by encouraging participation, open-mindedness, learning, and safety in every interaction. This applies equally to founders, mentors, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

More than just a guideline, all participants in our team are required to agree with and abide by the following code of conduct. Team admins will enforce this code at all times. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

> tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk, work to make things better

# Need Help?

Contact one of the team admins. Our policy is not to lurk with our badges on, but you can message the admins:

# The Quick Version

TechATX is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any context or at any time, including in public channel, in private messages, or via any other messaging or social media network.  Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the team at the discretion of the community organisers.

# The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive comments (online, verbal, or otherwise, irrespective of media) related to identity, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexualised commentary, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately - although we hope it won't come to that point.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the team temporarily or permanently.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns that you do not wish to address on your own, please contact a team admin immediately.

Team admins will be happy to help participants through direct intervention, contacting local law enforcement, or by otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your active participation in the community.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all times, on and offline, with everyone involved in the team. Harassment of our colleagues outside of TechATX will not be simply ignored.

# Recruiters

As professionals, we find it useful to keep abreast of the job market. As *working* professionals, we may hear from a lot recruiters. We welcome recruiters to our community, but ask that they confine their activities to the #jobs channel. Please refrain from repeated posts of the same position. Do not use unsolicited private messages.

# Sales, Marketing, and other Promoters

TechATX is for community members both new and old. You are not welcome to merely pitch your product or service. Come and get to know us, and then you can tell us about what you're working on that may interest members.
